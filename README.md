## Supported Systems

Macintosh and Linux.

## Install

This repository provides pre-built data for the font. Glyph data is
provided as compressed
[Type-1](https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF)
format. This is due to the limitation of GitHub to accept only less
than 100M byte file size. (Uncompressed glyph data will exceed 120M
bytes.) To examine actual glyph data, you can convert the data to
[UFO](http://unifiedfontobject.org/), PDF or
[SVG Font](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/fonts.html) format by AFDKO *tx*
command.

To build the fonts, you need to install AFDKO and put their command
directory to $PATH. Suppose $AFDKO is
"/FDK/Tools/SharedData/FDKScripts" directory, run the following
commands to create the fonts. (Please keep in mind that it may take
long time to build the fonts.)

    mergeFonts -cid HanaMinA.cidinfo HanaMinA.raw HanaMinA.cidmap HanaMinA.pfa
    perl $AFDKO/hintcidfont.pl hintparam.txt < HanaMinA.raw > HanaMinA.hinted.raw
    autohint -r -q HanaMinA.hinted.raw
    makeotf -newNameID4 -mf HanaMinA.fmndb -cs 1 -ci HanaMinA.ivs -ch HanaMinA.cmap \
        -f HanaMinA.hinted.raw -ff HanaMinA.features -o HanaMinA.otf

    mergeFonts -cid HanaMinB.cidinfo HanaMinB.raw HanaMinB.cidmap HanaMinB.pfa
    perl $AFDKO/hintcidfont.pl hintparam.txt < HanaMinB.raw > HanaMinB.hinted.raw
    autohint -r -q HanaMinB.hinted.raw
    makeotf -newNameID4 -mf HanaMinB.fmndb -cs 1 -ci HanaMinB.ivs -ch HanaMinB.cmap \
        -f HanaMinB.hinted.raw -ff HanaMinB.features -o HanaMinB.otf

    perl $AFDKO/hintcidfont.pl hintparam.txt < HanaMinC.raw > HanaMinC.hinted.raw
    autohint -r -q HanaMinC.hinted.raw
