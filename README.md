## Supported Systems

Macintosh and Linux.

## Install

Binary file is provided as
[releases](http://github.com/cjkvi/HanaMinAFDKO/releases). This
repository provides pre-built data for the font. Glyph data is
provided as compressed [SVG
Font](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/fonts.html) format. This is due to the
limitation of GitHub to accept only less than 100M byte file size.
(Uncompressed glyph data would exceed 120M bytes.) 

To build the fonts, you need to install newest [AFDKO from
github](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko) (as of Jan. 2018)
and [Adobe Type Tools / Perl
Scripts](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/perl-scripts). Then put
the directory of perl scripts to $ADOBE_PERL variable, such as
"$HOME/.ghq/github.com/adobe-type-tools/perl-scripts/".

Then, run the following commands to create the fonts. (Please keep in
mind that it may take long time to build the fonts.)

    unxz HanaMinA.svg.xz
    tx -t1 HanaMinA.svg HanaMinA.pfa >>HanaMinA.log 2>>HanaMinA.err
    mergeFonts -cid HanaMinA.cidinfo HanaMinA.raw HanaMinA.cidmap HanaMinA.pfa >>HanaMinA.log 2>>HanaMinA.err
    # checkOutlines -e -k -O -x HanaMinA.pfa >/dev/null 2>>HanaMinA.err
    perl $(ADOBE_PERL)/hintcidfont.pl hintparam.txt < HanaMinA.raw > HanaMinA.hinted.raw
